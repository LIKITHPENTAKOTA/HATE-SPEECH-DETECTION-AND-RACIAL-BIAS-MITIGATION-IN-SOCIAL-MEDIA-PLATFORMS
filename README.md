# HATE-SPEECH-DETECTION-AND-RACIAL-BIAS-MITIGATION-IN-SOCIAL-MEDIA-PLATFORMS
###presented a service framework called Hate Classify for hate speech detection on social media. The Hate Classify framework employs a crowed-sourced approach that permits the social media users to vote about any textual speech or content that is deemed inappropriate. To evaluate the performance in terms of classification, the CNNs were employed and experimental results demonstrate that the classification accuracy achieved through the CNN models, particularly the SCNN is significantly competitive and even better than several state-of-the-art approaches.
