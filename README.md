### presented a service framework called Hate Classify for hate speech detection on social media. The Hate Classify framework employs a crowed-sourced approach that permits the social media users to vote about any textual speech or content that is deemed inappropriate. 
### To evaluate the performance in terms of classification, the CNNs were employed and experimental results demonstrate that the classification accuracy achieved through the CNN models, particularly the SCNN is significantly competitive and even better than several state-of-the-art approaches.
### An important contribution  is that it presents the problem of hate speech classification as the multi label classification problem. 
### The experimental results attained by employing the CNN approaches both for the multiclass classification and multi label classification are sufficiently encouraging and signify the feasibility of these approaches for hate speech classification on social media.
